# React Solo Rules - Solo Development Template

Professional solo workflow optimized for React development with modern tooling and best practices.



## AFTER SETUP - FIRST CHAT BEHAVIOR

**IMPORTANT: When user starts a new chat after running setup, YOU must proactively guide them!**

### ON FIRST MESSAGE:
1. Say: "RULE VALIDATION: I now automatically follow all rules!"

2. Execute `git log --oneline 2>/dev/null | wc -l` to count commits

3. **If NEW PROJECT (0 or 1 commit):**
   - **Tell user:** "This looks like a new project! You can say 'top' and I'll initialize git properly with clean history."
   - **Explain:** "The 'top' command triggers git initialization and first commit."
   - **WAIT for user to say "top"** before doing anything!

4. **If EXISTING PROJECT (2+ commits):**
   - **Count commits** and remember this number for versioning
   - **Check if versions exist:** `git log --oneline -1 | grep -oE 'v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\+[0-9]+'`
   - **If version found:** Continue from that version (e.g., v1.2.3+45 → v1.2.4+46)
   - **If NO version found:** Use commit count: `v0.1.0+{commit_count}` (e.g., 23 commits → v0.1.0+23)
   - **Tell user:** "Ready to work! Say 'top' after testing your changes to commit."

**This ensures correct version numbering from the start!**

⸻

##  ULTRA-CRITICAL: NEVER COMMIT WITHOUT "TOP" CONFIRMATION! 

**ABSOLUTE RULE #1: DO NOT COMMIT ANYTHING WITHOUT USER SAYING "TOP"!**

### **THE ONLY WAY TO COMMIT:**
1. User gives tasks → You make ALL changes
2. User tests in browser → Checks if everything works
3. **User says "top"** → ONLY THEN you commit!

### **FORBIDDEN:**
-  Auto-committing after changes
-  Committing because "work is done"
-  Committing without explicit "top" confirmation
-  Asking "should I commit?" (just wait for "top")

### **ALLOWED:**
-  ONLY commit when user explicitly says "top"
-  Wait patiently after completing changes
-  User says "top" = green light to commit

**IF YOU COMMIT WITHOUT "TOP" = YOU VIOLATED THE MOST CRITICAL RULE!**

This prevents broken commits and gives user control over when commits happen.



## Git Workflow: Solo Dev-First (React Optimized)

```
• All development on dev branch for rapid React iteration
• Merge to main for production deployments
• Perfect for React SPA, Next.js, React Native projects
• Compatible with npm/yarn/pnpm workflows
```

### React Solo Development Commands
```bash
# Daily React development
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# Develop new feature (multiple logical changes)
git add src/components/UserProfile.jsx src/hooks/useAuth.js src/styles/profile.css
# User tests everything in browser, then says "top"
# AI commits each logical change separately:
# git commit -m "feat: add UserProfile component with responsive design (v0.8.0+45)"
# git commit -m "feat: add useAuth hook with token management (v0.8.0+46)"
# git commit -m "style: add profile page styling with dark mode (v0.8.0+47)"
git push origin dev

# When ready for production deployment
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff dev
git tag v0.8.0
git push origin main --tags
git checkout dev
```



## Forbidden Operations

• **NEVER** `git reset --hard` on dev/main
• **NEVER** force-push without `--force-with-lease`
• **NEVER** commit directly to main
• **NEVER** commit with failing tests
• **NEVER** commit without linting (ESLint) passing
• **NEVER** commit with console errors in browser
• **CRITICAL VERSION RULE:** NEVER "invent" versions - ALWAYS check `git log` first!
• **VERSION VALIDATION:** Before each commit validate current version and correctly calculate next version!
• **VERSION SEQUENCE RULE:** No duplicate patch versions and no skipped build numbers!
• **MANDATORY:** After every file change IMMEDIATELY check read_lints and fix!
• **NEVER** mix multiple logical changes in one commit!
• **NEVER** unsafe error handling - always handle errors properly!
• **NEVER** use uppercase or unclear commit messages!
• **NEVER** push when build is failing!
• **CRITICAL:** NEVER leave syntax errors or build errors open!
• **NEVER** commit without "top" confirmation from user!

### **VERSION SEQUENCE CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] **Check Patch Version**: Is the previous patch version identical?
- [ ] **Check Build Number**: Is the next build number +1?
- [ ] **Validate Version Type**: PATCH vs MINOR correctly determined?
- [ ] **No Duplicates**: Use same patch version only once
- [ ] **No Jumps**: Build numbers must be sequential



## SOLO "TOP" CONFIRMATION WORKFLOW:
**BASIC PRINCIPLE: User says "top" → AI commits all logical changes separately**

### **SOLO WORKFLOW:**
1. **User gives tasks** → "Add user profile component, create auth hook, style the page"
2. **AI makes ALL changes** → 3 logical changes ready
3. **User tests in browser** → Checks components, interactions, responsiveness
4. **User says "top"** → AI commits each logical change as separate commit
5. **Continue working** → "top - now let's add the shopping cart functionality"

### **"TOP" EFFICIENCY:**
- **Combine requests**: "top - and also add mobile responsive navigation"
- **Save tokens**: Don't send "top" alone
- **Keep momentum**: "top - now let's optimize the performance with React.memo"



##  CRITICAL: MINOR RELEASE MERGE TO MAIN

**RULE:** Every commit with version 0.X.0 (where X changes) = IMMEDIATE merge to main!

**WORKFLOW FOR MINOR RELEASES (0.X.0):**
1.  Commit on dev: `git commit -m "feat: add shopping cart (v0.9.0)"`
2.  **STOP! This is a MINOR release (0.9.0)!**
3.  **IMMEDIATELY merge to main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge --no-ff dev
   git tag v0.9.0
   git push origin main --tags
   git checkout dev
   ```
4.  Continue work on dev

**WHEN TO MERGE TO MAIN:**
-  **YES:** v0.6.0, v0.7.0, v0.8.0, v1.0.0 (X changes in 0.X.0)
-  **NO:** v0.6.1, v0.6.2, v0.6.33 (only Y changes in 0.X.Y)

**EXAMPLES OF MINOR FEATURES:**
- New React components/screens ( = 0.X.0)
- Authentication system ( = 0.X.0)
- README/Documentation updates ( = 0.X.0)
- Major UI redesign ( = 0.X.0)
- Bug fixes, small tweaks ( = 0.X.Y - PATCH only)



## Universal Coding Principles (React-Optimized)
- Use functional components with hooks (no class components)
- **React-specific:** Use React.memo for performance optimization
- **React-specific:** Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Trailing commas in JSX props – more readable, better diffs
- Structure files logically: imports → constants → component → styles → export
- **Dynamic configuration:** Version numbers MUST be loaded from package.json, never hardcoded
- **Follow React documentation** and best practices at all times
- **Document complex components** with PropTypes or TypeScript



## Commit Standards

### Commit Message Format
```
type: description (v0.X.Y+Z)
```

**React-specific types:**
- `feat`: New components, hooks, pages
- `fix`: Bug fixes in components or logic
- `style`: CSS/styling changes
- `refactor`: Component restructuring without behavior change
- `perf`: Performance improvements (memoization, lazy loading)
- `test`: Jest/React Testing Library additions
- `build`: Build system changes (webpack, vite, etc.)

**Examples:**
- `feat: add UserDashboard component with data fetching (v0.8.0+45)`
- `fix: resolve infinite re-render in useEffect hook (v0.7.15+46)`
- `perf: add React.memo to expensive list components (v0.7.16+47)`



## Semantic Versioning: React

### Version File: `package.json`

**MINOR (0.X.0) - React specific:**
- New pages/routes
- New major components
- New external integrations (APIs, services)
- Major UI redesigns
- New features (authentication, payment, etc.)
- State management changes

**PATCH (0.X.Y) - React specific:**
- Bug fixes
- Performance optimizations
- Styling improvements
- Dependency updates
- Minor component tweaks

### **CRITICAL VERSION TYPE RULES:**
- **Content revisions** = MINOR (0.X.0) - NOT PATCH!
- **README/Documentation updates** = MINOR (0.X.0) - NOT PATCH!
- **Fundamental text changes** = MINOR (0.X.0) - NOT PATCH!
- **Only small corrections** = PATCH (0.X.Y)



## React Quality Standards

### Pre-commit Requirements
```bash
# Always run before commit
npm run lint          # ESLint + React rules
npm test              # Jest + React Testing Library
npm run build         # Production build test
```

### ESLint Configuration for React
```json
{
  "extends": [
    "react-app",
    "react-app/jest",
    "eslint:recommended"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "error",
    "react/prop-types": "error",
    "no-unused-vars": "error"
  }
}
```



## React Architecture

### Project Structure
```
src/
 components/       # Reusable components
 pages/           # Page components
 hooks/           # Custom hooks
 services/        # API calls and external services
 utils/           # Helper functions
 styles/          # CSS/SCSS files
 contexts/        # React contexts
 __tests__/       # Test files
```

### Component Standards
- One component per file
- Props validation with PropTypes or TypeScript
- Proper error boundaries
- Meaningful component names
- Consistent file naming (PascalCase for components)



## Healthy React Project

### Technical Health
• Zero ESLint warnings
• No console errors in browser
• 80%+ test coverage
• Fast hot reload
• Optimized bundle size
• Proper error handling

### Development Health
• Fast development server startup
• Reliable test suite
• Clear component hierarchy
• Good performance (no unnecessary re-renders)
• Consistent styling approach



**React Solo Rule:**
If you think "Should I add another prop to this component?" → No, split it into smaller components.
Small, focused components are the foundation of maintainable React apps.

**Solo Start Rule:**
1. "REACT SOLO RULES ACTIVE: Following solo React development standards!"
2. `git status` - check current state
3. `npm run lint && npm test && npm run build` - verify code quality
4. Always work on dev branch, wait for "top" confirmation before committing!



##  CRITICAL REMINDERS (READ TWICE!)

These rules are repeated because they are CRITICAL for React projects:

### **PROJECT TYPE DETECTION (CRITICAL!)**
** NEVER DELETE GIT HISTORY FROM EXISTING PROJECTS! **

**How to detect:**
```bash
git log --oneline 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

**Results:**
- **0 commits:** New project (no git) → initialize fresh
- **1 commit:** New project (GitHub template) → delete & reinitialize  
- **2+ commits:** Existing project → KEEP HISTORY, implant vasgit

**NEVER assume! ALWAYS count commits first!**

This prevents catastrophic data loss from deleting existing git histories!

### **VERSION VALIDATION (CRITICAL!)**
**NEVER "INVENT" VERSIONS - ALWAYS CHECK GIT LOG FIRST!**

```bash
# Before EVERY commit:
git log --oneline -3  # Check actual last version
# Then calculate next version correctly
```

### **"TOP" CONFIRMATION (CRITICAL!)**
**WHEN USER SAYS "top" - AUTOMATICALLY DETECT PROJECT TYPE:**

**STEP 1: Check git state**
```bash
git log --oneline 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

**SCENARIO A: No git repo (count = 0) → NEW PROJECT**
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit (v0.1.0+1)"
git branch dev
git checkout dev
```

**SCENARIO B: Only 1 commit (GitHub template) → NEW PROJECT**
```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit (v0.1.0+1)"
git branch dev
git checkout dev
```

** CRITICAL: First push needs --force!**
- Why? Git history was reinitialized (old remote history diverged)
- Command: `git push origin main --force`
- Later pushes: Normal `git push origin main`

**SCENARIO C: Multiple commits (2+) → EXISTING PROJECT**
- Message: `chore: implant vasgit into project (vX.Y.Z+N)`
- Version detection:
  1. Check last commit for version: `git log --oneline -1 | grep -oE 'v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\+[0-9]+'`
  2. If found → continue from there (e.g., v1.2.3+45 → v1.2.4+46)
  3. If NOT found → use commit count: `0.1.0+{commit_count}` (e.g., 23 commits → v0.1.0+23)
- Create `dev` branch if it doesn't exist
- Switch to `dev` branch

**KEY POINT:** User ONLY says "top" - YOU detect and handle automatically!

### **SEMANTIC VERSIONING (CRITICAL!)**
**React-specific MINOR triggers:**
- New pages/routes = MINOR (0.X.0)
- New major components = MINOR (0.X.0)
- README updates = MINOR (0.X.0)

**PATCH only for:**
- Bug fixes, styling improvements, minor tweaks = PATCH (0.X.Y)

### **ONE LOGICAL CHANGE = ONE COMMIT (CRITICAL!)**
Bad: "feat: add UserProfile and navigation and styling (v0.8.0+45)"

Good (3 separate commits):
- "feat: add UserProfile component with data fetching (v0.8.0+45)"
- "feat: add navigation component (v0.8.0+46)"
- "style: add UserProfile styling (v0.8.0+47)"

### **VERSION SEQUENCE (CRITICAL!)**
Correct: v0.8.0+45 → v0.8.0+46 → v0.8.1+47 
Wrong: v0.8.0+45 → v0.8.0+47  (skipped +46)

### **REACT-SPECIFIC CRITICAL RULES:**
- NO console errors in browser before commit
- Run `npm run lint && npm test` before EVERY commit
- Check for unnecessary re-renders before commit



**These rules are non-negotiable. Follow them EXACTLY. Every time.**
