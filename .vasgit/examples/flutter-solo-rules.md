# Flutter Solo Rules - Solo Development Template

Professional solo workflow optimized for Flutter development with Dart and modern mobile app best practices.

⸻

## Git Workflow: Solo Dev-First (Flutter Optimized)

```
• All development on dev branch for rapid Flutter iteration
• Merge to main for production releases
• Perfect for mobile apps, cross-platform development
• Compatible with Flutter/Dart workflows
```

### Flutter Solo Development Commands
```bash
# Daily Flutter development
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# Develop new feature (multiple logical changes)
git add lib/screens/profile_screen.dart lib/providers/auth_provider.dart lib/widgets/custom_button.dart
# User tests everything in emulator, then says "top"
# AI commits each logical change separately:
# git commit -m "feat: add profile screen with responsive layout (v0.8.0+45)"
# git commit -m "feat: add authentication provider with state management (v0.8.0+46)"
# git commit -m "feat: add custom button widget with animations (v0.8.0+47)"
git push origin dev

# When ready for production deployment
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff dev
git tag v0.8.0
git push origin main --tags
git checkout dev
```

## Forbidden Operations

• **NEVER** `git reset --hard` on dev/main
• **NEVER** force-push without `--force-with-lease`
• **NEVER** commit directly to main
• **NEVER** commit with failing tests
• **NEVER** commit without linting (dart analyze) passing
• **NEVER** commit with widget rebuild issues
• **CRITICAL VERSION RULE:** NEVER "invent" versions - ALWAYS check `git log` first!
• **VERSION VALIDATION:** Before each commit validate current version and correctly calculate next version!
• **VERSION SEQUENCE RULE:** No duplicate patch versions and no skipped build numbers!
• **MANDATORY:** After every file change IMMEDIATELY check read_lints and fix!
• **NEVER** mix multiple logical changes in one commit!
• **NEVER** unsafe error handling - always handle errors properly!
• **NEVER** use uppercase or unclear commit messages!
• **NEVER** push when build is failing!
• **CRITICAL:** NEVER leave syntax errors or build errors open!
• **NEVER** commit without "top" confirmation from user!

### **VERSION SEQUENCE CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] **Check Patch Version**: Is the previous patch version identical?
- [ ] **Check Build Number**: Is the next build number +1?
- [ ] **Validate Version Type**: PATCH vs MINOR correctly determined?
- [ ] **No Duplicates**: Use same patch version only once
- [ ] **No Jumps**: Build numbers must be sequential

⸻

## SOLO "TOP" CONFIRMATION WORKFLOW:
**BASIC PRINCIPLE: User says "top" → AI commits all logical changes separately**

### **SOLO WORKFLOW:**
1. **User gives tasks** → "Add profile screen, create auth provider, build custom button"
2. **AI makes ALL changes** → 3 logical changes ready
3. **User tests in emulator** → Checks UI, interactions, state management
4. **User says "top"** → AI commits each logical change as separate commit
5. **Continue working** → "top - now let's add the shopping cart feature"

### **"TOP" EFFICIENCY:**
- **Combine requests**: "top - and also add offline mode with local storage"
- **Save tokens**: Don't send "top" alone
- **Keep momentum**: "top - now let's optimize the animations for 60fps"

⸻

## Universal Coding Principles (Flutter-Optimized)
- Use const constructors wherever possible for performance
- **Flutter-specific:** StatelessWidget over StatefulWidget when possible
- **Flutter-specific:** Use Provider/Riverpod for state management
- **Dart-specific:** Final and const for immutability
- Trailing commas in widget trees – more readable, better diffs
- Structure files logically: imports → constants → widgets → state → export
- **Dynamic configuration:** Version numbers MUST be loaded from pubspec.yaml, never hardcoded
- **Follow Flutter documentation** and best practices at all times
- **Document complex widgets** with clear comments

⸻

## Commit Standards

### Commit Message Format
```
type: description (v0.X.Y+Z)
```

**Flutter-specific types:**
- `feat`: New screens, widgets, features
- `fix`: Bug fixes in UI or logic
- `style`: UI/UX styling changes
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without behavior change
- `perf`: Performance improvements (animations, rebuilds)
- `test`: Widget/integration test additions
- `deps`: Dependency updates (pubspec.yaml)

**Examples:**
- `feat: add user profile screen with animations (v0.8.0+45)`
- `fix: resolve setState called after dispose error (v0.7.15+46)`
- `perf: optimize list view with const widgets (v0.7.16+47)`

⸻

## Semantic Versioning: Flutter

### Version File: `pubspec.yaml`

**MINOR (0.X.0) - Flutter specific:**
- New screens/pages
- New major features
- Navigation structure changes
- New state management providers
- Major UI redesigns
- New platform integrations (camera, location, etc.)

**PATCH (0.X.Y) - Flutter specific:**
- Bug fixes
- UI/UX improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Dependency updates
- Minor widget tweaks

### **CRITICAL VERSION TYPE RULES:**
- **Content revisions** = MINOR (0.X.0) - NOT PATCH!
- **README/Documentation updates** = MINOR (0.X.0) - NOT PATCH!
- **Fundamental text changes** = MINOR (0.X.0) - NOT PATCH!
- **Only small corrections** = PATCH (0.X.Y)

⸻

## Flutter Quality Standards

### Pre-commit Requirements
```bash
# Always run before commit
flutter analyze          # Dart analyzer
flutter test            # Run all tests
flutter build apk --debug  # Ensure build works (or ios)
```

### Dart Analyzer Configuration
```yaml
# analysis_options.yaml
analyzer:
  strong-mode:
    implicit-casts: false
    implicit-dynamic: false
  errors:
    missing_required_param: error
    missing_return: error

linter:
  rules:
    - prefer_const_constructors
    - prefer_const_declarations
    - use_key_in_widget_constructors
    - avoid_print
```

⸻

## Flutter Architecture

### Project Structure
```
lib/
├── main.dart           # App entry point
├── screens/           # Screen widgets
├── widgets/           # Reusable widgets
├── providers/         # State management (Provider/Riverpod)
├── models/            # Data models
├── services/          # API calls and external services
├── utils/             # Helper functions
├── constants/         # Constants and themes
└── tests/             # Test files
```

### Widget Standards
- Use const constructors for immutable widgets
- Extract complex widgets into separate files
- Keep widget trees readable (max 3-4 levels deep before extracting)
- Use meaningful widget names
- Proper key usage for list items
- Avoid unnecessary setState calls

### State Management Best Practices
- Use Provider/Riverpod for app-wide state
- Keep state as local as possible
- Avoid rebuilding entire trees
- Use Consumer widgets strategically
- Proper disposal of controllers and listeners

⸻

## Flutter Performance Guidelines

### Widget Optimization
- Use const constructors everywhere possible
- Avoid rebuilding unchanged widgets
- Use ListView.builder for long lists
- Implement proper image caching
- Use RepaintBoundary for complex animations

### Performance Checklist
- [ ] No unnecessary widget rebuilds
- [ ] Animations run at 60fps
- [ ] Images properly sized and cached
- [ ] Lists use builder constructors
- [ ] No expensive operations in build methods

⸻

## Healthy Flutter Project

### Technical Health
• Zero dart analyze warnings
• 80%+ test coverage (widget + integration tests)
• Smooth animations (60fps)
• Fast app startup time
• Proper error handling throughout
• Clean pubspec.yaml

### Development Health
• Fast hot reload
• Reliable test suite
• Clear widget hierarchy
• Good separation of concerns
• Consistent code style
• Responsive layouts (all screen sizes)

⸻

## Flutter Testing

### Test Categories
```dart
// Widget tests
testWidgets('Button displays correct text', (tester) async {
  await tester.pumpWidget(MyButton());
  expect(find.text('Click Me'), findsOneWidget);
});

// Integration tests
testWidgets('Login flow works correctly', (tester) async {
  await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp());
  await tester.enterText(find.byKey(Key('email')), 'test@test.com');
  await tester.tap(find.byKey(Key('loginButton')));
  await tester.pumpAndSettle();
  expect(find.text('Welcome'), findsOneWidget);
});
```

⸻

**Flutter Solo Rule:**
If you think "Should I make this widget more complex?" → No, extract it into a smaller widget.
Small, focused widgets are the foundation of maintainable Flutter apps.

**Solo Start Rule:**
1. "FLUTTER SOLO RULES ACTIVE: Following solo Flutter development standards!"
2. `git status` - check current state
3. `flutter analyze && flutter test` - verify code quality
4. Always work on dev branch, wait for "top" confirmation before committing!


⸻

## 🔴 CRITICAL REMINDERS (READ TWICE!)

These rules are repeated because they are CRITICAL:

### **NEW PROJECT SETUP (CRITICAL!)**
**🚨 WHEN USER SAYS "top" - YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST! 🚨**

**STEP 1: Check if git exists**
```bash
git log --oneline -1 2>/dev/null
```

**STEP 2: If git exists → DELETE IT and start fresh!**
```bash
rm -rf .git
```

**STEP 3: Initialize clean git repo**
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit (v0.1.0+1)"
git branch dev
git checkout dev
```

**WHY?** To remove GitHub's "Initial commit" and create a clean history with proper author and versioning!

**THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL - ALWAYS DO THIS FOR NEW VASGIT PROJECTS!**


### **VERSION VALIDATION (CRITICAL!)**
**NEVER "INVENT" VERSIONS - ALWAYS CHECK GIT LOG FIRST!**

Before EVERY commit:
1. Execute: `git log --oneline -3`
2. Identify the ACTUAL last version
3. Calculate next version based on change type
4. NEVER guess or assume versions

### **"TOP" CONFIRMATION (CRITICAL!)**
**NEVER COMMIT WITHOUT USER SAYING "TOP"!**
- User says "top" = Permission to commit
- NO automatic commits before "top"

### **SEMANTIC VERSIONING (CRITICAL!)**
- README/Documentation updates = MINOR (0.X.0)
- New features = MINOR (0.X.0)
- Bug fixes = PATCH (0.X.Y)

### **ONE LOGICAL CHANGE = ONE COMMIT (CRITICAL!)**
NEVER MIX MULTIPLE LOGICAL CHANGES IN ONE COMMIT!

### **VERSION SEQUENCE (CRITICAL!)**
NO DUPLICATE PATCH VERSIONS! NO SKIPPED BUILD NUMBERS!

Correct: v0.8.0+45 → v0.8.0+46 → v0.8.1+47 ✓
Wrong: v0.8.0+45 → v0.8.0+47 ✗ (skipped +46)

⸻

**These rules are non-negotiable. Follow them EXACTLY. Every time.**
